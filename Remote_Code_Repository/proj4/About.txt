About Project4Demo
=======================================================
1. Project4Demo is intended to help you pull all the necessary 
   parts for Project #4 together into a single solution:
   - GUI client
   - Server
   - MsgPassingComm
   - NoSqlDb
   Some supporting actors are needed as well:
   - CommLibWrapper
   - DateTime
   - DbCore
   - FileSystem
   - PayLoad
   - Sockets
   - Translater
   - Utilities
   - XmlDocument
2. This is not a complete solution for the Project #4 Requirements
   but it does give you a framework for implementing them.
3. There are Tabs:
   - Local to show client files and directories.
   - Remote to show server files and directories.
   - Connect to suggest one way to avoid hard-coding machine endpoints.
     It's blank now.
   - Query to suggest a way for you to show selected contents of the db.
     It's blank now.
   - About displays the text of this file.
3. What it does do:
   - Shows local and remote directories and files.
   - Double-clicking on a directory navigates into that directory
     and shows its contents for both the local and remote locations.
   - Double-clicking on a file in local navigator will send the file 
     from the client to server.  Note that this is not a checkin.
     It just sends the file to the server's saveFiles directory.
     The server, in this demo, doesn't have a ServerProc for receiving
     files, so it reports an unknown command.  Providing that is up
     to you.
   - Double-clicking on a file in remote navigator will send the file 
     from the server to client.  Note that this is not a checkout.
     It just sends the file to the client's saveFiles directory and
     pops up a code viewing window.
   - On startup the server instantiates it's NoSqlDb with a demo
     element and displays on the console.  This shows you how to get
     the Server to read and write from/to the db.  It does not do
     anything else with the db.  That's up to you.
4. There is also a grid row on the main display suitable for use as
   a status bar.  You will need to add a TextBlock or StatusBar
   element and write to it when that seems appropriate.  This demo
   does not do that.
